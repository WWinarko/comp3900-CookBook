--- WEEK ONE ---

Thursday 16/09/21 (lab class)
    - Met with the group during the lab time. Introductions and shared skills. 
    - We talked through all the project options, and decided on Topic 5 (E-commerce recommender).
    - We also discussed preferred programming languages. Python was a popular one amongst all members. 
    - The team also discussed roles within the team: 
        2 front end devs (Wincent + Louis),
        2 back end devs (Maria + Trina),
        Myself as the scrum master.
    - I created a Jira board and added group members and Matthew (mentor)
    - Maria also set up a Google document to start working on the first milestone

Saturday 18/09/21
    - I started writing up some background information for the topic based on need for e-commerce.
    - Possible idea of site to sell food from distributers (restaurants)
        Users would be consumers, admin would be restaurants
        Recommendations made based on taste, cruisine, price, time

Sunday 19/09/21 (team meeting)
    - We discussed in more depth our chosen topic
    - Wincent suggested choosing books, so that we can focus on one type of item to sell. 
    - Similarly, Maria suggested looking into selling candles/ aromatiser.
    - We generally struggled with finding something which we could add novel features to, while also being reasonable to implement.
    - Next meeting: brainstorm more ideas which can have novel functions. Discuss before checking with Matthew.
